# Pitch-By-Pitch Baseball Simulator
The goal of this project is to predict the outcome of MLB at-bats using Statcast data by generating probable outcomes of each pitch and stochastically selecting an outcome.

## Inputs
A Python script will be used to make a database of relevant inputs for both pitchers and hitters. The following are the inputs gathered:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

## Outputs
Below is a list of the possible outputs from the model using the inputs outlined above. Each output will be weighted with a probability and we use a random number generator to select the output for each pitch. This work will be done in a simulation program written in Rust.
